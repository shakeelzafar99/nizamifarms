/**
 * THE REGRESSION GATE for the machine-keyed CLAIM CHAINS (Aug-20-2026).
 *
 * The Bikes screen chains two things per claim: "km since last fill" and "km since
 * last service". Both were keyed to the RIDER while everything around them had moved
 * to the MACHINE, so both were wrong the moment a bike changed hands. This proves:
 *
 *   1. the fuel chip now measures the BIKE's previous tank, whoever filled it —
 *      including the handover rows that used to inflate (600 for a 142 km tank) and
 *      the ones that used to print nothing at all;
 *   2. the service chip can no longer contradict the frozen `service_due_km` printed
 *      on the same row, and non-clock-resetting jobs are no longer judged at all;
 *   3. a machine that has genuinely never passed 1,000 km can hold a service clock,
 *      and NO other machine's answer moves by a kilometre;
 *   4. money never moves: the month's headline fuel/maintenance totals are identical
 *      with the engine on and off;
 *   5. `MACHINE_ATTRIBUTION = 'N'` still restores the old rider-keyed answers exactly.
 *
 * ⚠ It writes a config row and MUST put it back — undo is registered before the first
 *   mutation and unwound in reverse (the standing harness rule). Nothing else is
 *   written: every other assertion is a read.
 *
 * Run:  php test_claim_chain.php
