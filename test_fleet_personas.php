/**
 * THE FOUR PERSONAS — can each of them actually do their job? (3-Sep-2026)
 *
 * The owner's ask: check Qasim (frozen mode), Shabib (store), Taimur, and Farooq (who must see
 * that a rider has a workshop day, plus the notification from Qasim) — that everything they had
 * BEFORE still works, that everything added in this round is reachable for the right person and
 * refused for the wrong one, and that manual meters / maintenance entered by other routes all
 * still feed ONE engine for readings and alerts.
 *
 * ⚠ This asserts the SEAMS between permission and surface — the class of bug a feature test
 *   cannot see, because each feature works perfectly for whoever wrote the test.
 *
 * ⚠ Every mutation is inside a transaction that is always rolled back. No user is logged in:
 *   every service takes the actor as an argument, which is also the contract being checked.
