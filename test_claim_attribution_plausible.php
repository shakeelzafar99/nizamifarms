/**
 * A CLAIM'S ODOMETER MUST FIT THE MACHINE IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO (Aug-28 2026).
 *
 * The reported symptom: Danish's 30-Aug fill on CEN-455 (meter 17,286) showed
 * "meter vs last fill doesn't add up", even though his 29-Aug fill on the same bike
 * (17,209) sat right before it — 77 km earlier.
 *
 * The cause was not the fill chain. CEN-455 was registered on 22-Aug with Waseem as
 * its first keeper, and `attributionWindows` extends a first keeper's window back to
 * PRE_REGISTRY_FROM so pre-registry history is not lost. That swept every unstamped
 * claim Waseem had ever filed onto CEN-455 — including his DCR-799 fills at
 * 24,588–24,822. Those became CEN-455's fuel chain, so its last plausible anchor sat
 * at 24,822 and every later fill was measured against it and flagged. Permanently:
 * the anchor only advances on a plausible delta, so the series never healed.
 *
 * What these prove:
 *   §1 an impossible odometer no longer attaches to a machine by window guess;
 *   §2 the money is not lost — it lands on the machine it actually fits;
 *   §3 recorded facts (a stamp, a day override) are never second-guessed;
 *   §4 it fails open — a machine with no spine still inherits its keeper's history;
 *   §5 the end result: the chain the user expected.
 *
 * Run:  php test_claim_attribution_plausible.php
