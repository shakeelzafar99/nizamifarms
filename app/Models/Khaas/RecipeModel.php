/**
 * One version of one frozen product's recipe, written as a REFERENCE BATCH.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ WHY A BATCH AND NOT A PACKET. Qasim does not know "112 g of chicken per samosa
 * pack"; he knows "9 kg of chicken makes 80 packs". So that is what he types, and the
 * per-pack figure is DERIVED (`qty_per_basis / basis_packets`) and never stored. One
 * number to correct instead of two that can disagree, and the same denominator — packs
 * — that "Made" is already counted in everywhere else in Frozen.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY VERSIONS. Consumption rows already written keep pointing at the version they
 * were made with, so correcting a recipe never silently restates last month. Restating
 * is the deliberate "Re-apply recipe for this month" action and nothing else.
 *
 * A product with no current recipe is not an error: it simply produces no consumption
 * and shows "no recipe" on the cost tile. Making packs must never be blocked by
 * paperwork.
