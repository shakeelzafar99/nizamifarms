/**
 * The start line for "how much is left", and the physical counts that reset it.
 *
 * Remaining is CUMULATIVE — a January bag of salt is still on the shelf in March — so
 * without a row here an ingredient honestly reports "not tracked" instead of a number
 * that looks precise and is wrong.
 *
 * A `count` RE-ANCHORS the running figure on its date: from then on, remaining is the
 * counted number plus what was bought after it, minus what was used after it.
 *
 * ⚠ It does NOT write a shortfall off as consumption, and it does not cost one. That is
 *   deliberate and it is NOT what the Supplies count does — there, the money is already
 *   spent on a packet that has left the shelf, so writing it off is just bookkeeping.
 *   Here, inventing consumption would inflate a cost per pack that is already an
 *   estimate, and nobody could tell the invented part from the measured part afterwards.
 *   A gap between the count and what the recipes expected is a fact worth SHOWING, not
 *   a number worth manufacturing.
 *
 * ⚠ "Strictly after" matters: a count already reflects everything that happened on its
 *   own day, so that day's purchases and usage are not applied on top of it.
