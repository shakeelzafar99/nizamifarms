/**
 * "My vehicle" — the rider's own machine, in his own app (Aug-2026).
 *
 * Owner's ask: the rider should see what is assigned to him, and on tapping it get
 * the history of his fuel and maintenance requests, the condition photos with their
 * dates, and the same fuel average the Bikes screen shows.
 *
 * ⭐ SELF-SCOPED, SO IT NEEDS NO PERMISSION. It resolves the CALLER's own
 *    assignment and returns only that machine. A rider seeing his own bike's
 *    odometer and his own claims is not new access — he filed those claims. The
 *    fleet-wide roster and everybody else's costs stay behind `view_bike_costs`,
 *    which this endpoint never consults and never exposes.
 *
 * ⭐ THE NUMBERS COME FROM FleetFuelService, NOT FROM A PARALLEL CALCULATION.
 *    `rs_per_fuelled_km` here is literally the row the Bikes tab renders for him,
 *    read from the same cache key. If a rider and a manager ever quote different
 *    figures for the same bike, one of them is reading a copy — so there is no copy.

             *    that date (`released_on >= $date`) so the kilometres he rode this morning stay
             *    attributed to him. Asked as "is it mine now", it means a handover does not
             *    reach the rider's phone **until midnight**. Measured on prod, 5-Sep: the bike
             *    moved to Rajab at 13:42:14 and Waseem's phone still showed
             *    "MY VEHICLE DCR-799" at 14:42 — with `my_stint` naming RAJAB underneath it.

     *      plants a point in the chain no real reading can ever match;
     *    • plausible for that machine (Rule P), so a typo cannot become its whole spine;
     *    • he may only touch a row HE entered. A manager's row is read-only to him —
