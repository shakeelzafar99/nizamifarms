 * ⭐⭐ THE ONE RULE THIS FEATURE LIVES BY: nothing here writes money. The card that
 * comes out of this controller is a SUGGESTION. It becomes a purchase only when the
 * person presses Submit, and only by going through
 * VendorController::recordWeightedPurchase — the same door a hand-typed purchase uses,
 * with the same validation, the same ledger posting and the same images. That is the
 * rule the NF Assistant already follows when it replays a WhatsApp purchase log, and it
 * is why a bad read can waste a minute but can never book a wrong purchase.
 *
 * ⭐ Names are matched with the Assistant's OWN resolver (PurchaseLogService), which
 * already carries every taught alias for this vendor. A receipt line learned here is
 * therefore learned everywhere, and there is no second matcher to drift.
