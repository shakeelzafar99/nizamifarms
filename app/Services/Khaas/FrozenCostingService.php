/**
 * Bought, used, left — and roughly what it cost.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THIS IS AN ESTIMATE AND SAYS SO. It multiplies a recipe standard by an average
 * purchase rate. It is not a stock audit and nothing here is an accounting entry: no
 * ledger row is read for its balance, written, or changed. Money keeps flowing exactly
 * as it does today and this class reads quantities beside it.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY AVERAGE RATE AND NOT FIFO. The Supplies pool draws FIFO because every take-out
 * posts a real expense against a real purchase. Nothing posts here, so FIFO would buy
 * legs, residue sweeps and a replay problem for no answer the owner would read
 * differently. The month's average rate per ingredient (falling back to the last month
 * that had one) gives the same management figure with none of that machinery — and the
 * consumption rows are already the right shape to add legs later if that changes.
 *
 * ⚠ MEAT IS NOT ESTIMATED. Meat is bought and consumed through the storage ledger,
 *   which is exact, so for meat ingredients this class reports what the ledger says and
 *   shows the recipe standard beside it as a comparison, never in place of it.
