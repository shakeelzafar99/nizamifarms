 * an ETA (home pin → today's shift office) + buffer deadline (work_expected_by). He then checks
 * in exactly as always — arriving past the deadline or skipping the home reading is RECORDED
 * (chips, monthly counts), and only blocks check-in once the manager turns the Phase-2 lock on
 * (config CHECKIN_ETA_LOCK=1; the checkin_unlock_* valve is the bypass).
 *
 * Pure DB-only logic lives here (state derivation, continuity rule, reporting); the ETA call at
 * arm-time lives in RiderController (it has the Google helpers) — same split as the home flow.

     * always compared a rider's morning reading against HIS OWN last close. The
     * day a rider swaps machines those are two different odometers, so the gap is
     * thousands of kilometres and he is met with *"your reading is LOWER, which
     * should be impossible"* — for a perfectly honest reading. The 1 km threshold
     * is deliberately tight (it is what catches real typos) so a swap could never
     * pass it. Comparing against the MACHINE's own last reading makes the same
     * check correct across a handover: whoever rode it last, that is where the
     * odometer stood.

     *   already treats that as "ask no question" (a brand-new bike, correctly).
     *
     * ⚠ A machine with NO history returns null rather than falling back to the
     *   rider's old bike — silence beats comparing against the wrong odometer,
     *   which is the very failure being fixed.
