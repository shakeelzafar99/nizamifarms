/**
 * THE fuel/maintenance claim rules — one implementation, every creation path.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * There are two ways a petrol or maintenance request can be created:
 *   1. the rider's own app          → API\RiderController::createRequest
 *   2. a manager filing FOR someone → Request\RequestController::store
 *      (the web form AND the mobile Store "create request" screen both post here)
 *
 * Every guard built in Jul-2026 lived only in (1). So a manager-filed company-bike
 * petrol claim skipped the meter requirement, the odometer sanity check and the
 * double-tap block entirely — and `RequestController::store` additionally stored
 * `meter_at_fill` ONLY for Maintenance, silently discarding the reading on Petrol.
 * That is the exact leak this class closes: the rules now live in ONE place and
 * both controllers call it.
 *
 * ⭐ EVERYTHING IS KEYED TO THE **TARGET** RIDER, never the actor. When Shabib
 *    files for Danish, it is Danish's bike, Danish's odometer history and Danish's
 *    company/own status that decide — the manager's own profile is irrelevant.
 *
 * The rules are unchanged in substance; this is a move, not a redesign. The one
 * deliberate widening is that the meter is now required for MAINTENANCE on a
 * company bike too, not just petrol (owner ruling Jul-29) — a service without the
 * odometer can never reset the bike's service clock, so it was always half-useless.
