 * 10,000 km / Chain Set / Misc), with repair types he adds as he goes.
 *
 * ⭐ The type is a LABEL on top of the existing machine flag, never a replacement
 * for it — see MaintenanceTypeModel. This service is the only thing that turns a
 * chosen type into `service_type`, and the only thing that builds the picker.
 *
 * ⚠ Guarded on Schema::hasTable throughout: the web files may be uploaded before
