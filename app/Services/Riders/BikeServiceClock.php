/**
 * Fleet & Fuel (Jul-2026) — the ONE place an approved bike service moves the
 * service-due clock.
 *
 * Lives here (not in RequestApprovalController) because a request can become
 * APPROVED on more than one path — the normal L1/L2 approve endpoint, the web
 * form's auto-approve-at-creation branch (a category with no approval levels),
 * and the short-cash-settlement auto-approves that call
 * RequestModel::processApproval() directly from LedgerController / the mobile
 * deposit flow. The hook is wired into processApproval() itself plus the
 * create-time auto-approve, so every current AND future path is covered without
 * each caller having to remember it.
 *
 * Deliberately silent and non-fatal — a failure here must never turn a
 * successful approval into an error for the approver. Idempotent — the stamp
 * is written once (service_due_km guard) and the clock never moves backwards,
 * so being invoked twice for the same request is a no-op.
