/**
 * ⭐⭐ "WHICH MACHINES DID THIS RIDER PUT KILOMETRES ON, ON THIS DATE?" — one answer,
 *    every surface (Aug-27 2026).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * `t_ops_attendance` holds exactly ONE meter pair per rider-day. That was fine while a
 * rider had one machine, and it stopped being fine the day Rajab started arriving on his
 * own bike and taking the van out mid-shift: his own bike's kilometres have nowhere to
 * live, so his per-km petrol claim — real money he is owed — simply stopped appearing.
 * The Aug-21/22 round made the mixed day RECORDABLE (per-reading vehicle stamps, plus the
 * vehicle meter log). This class is what makes it USABLE: it reassembles a rider's day
 * from every place a reading can legitimately live and hands back one leg per machine.
 *
 * ⭐ EVERY consumer reads THIS — the rider's attendance payload, the claim guards, the
 *   manager's petrol modal. That is the point: a rider must never be offered a claim the
 *   server will refuse, and a manager must never see a different day than the rider does.
 *   (This codebase has been bitten repeatedly by the same rule living in two places —
 *   three copies of "is this a transfer day", four of the sane-row predicate.)
 *
 * ⚠⚠ FAIL-OPEN, ALWAYS. An empty result means "no opinion", NEVER "he rode nothing".
 *    Callers must treat [] as "behave exactly as before". A read failure here must never
 *    remove a rider's claim button or block his money — that is strictly worse than the
 *    bug this class exists to fix.
 *
 * WHERE A READING CAN LIVE, and how each is attributed:
 *
 *   1. THE ATTENDANCE ROW — `meter_start` / `meter_end`, each carrying its own
 *      `meter_*_vehicle_id` stamp (step C, LIVE on prod). Stamps are the recorded FACT;
 *      when they are absent the machine is DERIVED via `vehicleForDay`, which is exactly
 *      today's behaviour, so history is untouched.
 *
 *   2. THE VEHICLE METER LOG (`t_ops_vehicle_meter_log`) — the manager-entered stint. Two
 *      kinds count as this rider's:
 *        • rows naming him as the driver, and
 *        • DRIVERLESS rows on a machine that is his own (see `ownMachineIdsFor`) —
 *          because an own bike's kilometres belong to its owner by construction, and in
 *          practice nobody fills the driver box: every log row on prod has it NULL.
 *      This is what makes the owner's ruling work — readings a manager types on the
 *      Vehicles page reach the rider's own claim on his phone.

     *   is stamped and the other is not, and it decides whether the unstamped one inherits
     *   the stamp. Too tight and a genuinely long day gets split into two phantom
     *   machines; the catastrophe it must catch is 6,434 → 73,959, which is 67,000.
