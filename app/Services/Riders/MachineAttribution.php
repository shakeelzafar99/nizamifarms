/**
 * ⭐⭐ THE ONE ATTRIBUTION ENGINE (Aug-2026) — every kilometre this month, walked
 *     MACHINE-FIRST and labelled with who owns it.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * The Bikes page had two lenses that could not agree. The Riders view chained a
 * rider's own attendance readings and never asked which bike produced them; the
 * Vehicles view chained the machine but had no idea a day had been shared. On a
 * handover both were wrong in opposite directions — Waseem carried 563 km of
 * DCR-799's August as "unattributed" (i.e. as suspicion) while 40 of those km were
 * Danish's overnight and 494 were days the two of them split. One walk, two lenses,
 * and the blame lands where the evidence actually points.
 *
 * ⭐ THE FIVE LEGS. Every stretch of odometer between two readings is exactly one:
 *
 *   on_duty      check-in → day close, one rider, his kilometres
 *   off_duty     between readings with nobody on shift — SAME rider both ends,
 *                so it is genuinely his (the commute, the evening errand)
 *   shared       a handover DAY: the morning reading is one rider's and the
 *                evening reading is the other's. The run is real, the split is
 *                unknowable, so it is charged to NEITHER man and named on both.
 *   transfer     a stretch whose two ends belong to different riders across a
 *                handover — the bike travelling between them. Nobody's fault.
 *   unaccounted  a stretch spanning a day someone WORKED with no usable reading:
 *                part work, part commute, unsplittable, credited to no one.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE INVARIANT, PER MACHINE:
 *        on_duty + off_duty + shared + transfer + unaccounted == the month's span
 *     `reconciles` reports it honestly rather than printing a total that disagrees
 *     with the header. Real August: DCR-799 = 674 + 40 + 494 + 29 + 0 = 1,237. ✓
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THREE RULES THAT LOOK LIKE DETAILS AND ARE NOT
 *
 * R-A  ONE MACHINE PER RIDER-DAY, decided by `VehicleResolver`. The older code
 *      pulled each keeper's attendance per assignment WINDOW, so a rider holding
 *      two machines across one day (Farooq: van in the morning, EDN-198 from the
 *      8th) had the SAME readings ingested into BOTH chains. Worse, a same-day
 *      assign/release slip put DCR-799's 25,223 into Danish's own bike's ~24,500
 *      chain as ~700 phantom km. The resolver already answers this question for the
 *      live gates; the analytics must ask it too, or the two disagree.
 *
 * R-B  PLAUSIBILITY IS RELATIVE TO THE MACHINE'S OWN CHAIN — never an absolute
 *      floor. The old rule refused any reading under 1,000 km as a dropped digit,
 *      which is right for a 47,000 km bike and catastrophic for a NEW one: every
 *      reading EDN-198 has ever produced (0–429) was discarded, which is precisely
 *      why the live page says "Rs 3,800 could not be tied to any kilometres —
 *      Farooq". Typos are caught by the chain instead (backwards, or a jump beyond
 *      MAX_GAP_KM), which is strictly stronger: it also catches a typo of 45,000 on
 *      a bike that reads 400, which no floor ever would.
 *
 * R-C  A SAME-DAY ASSIGN+RELEASE BLIP IS INVISIBLE. It never wins the resolver for
 *      a day that has readings, so it contributes nothing here — no special case is
 *      needed, which is the point. (The UI hides such rows from month views and
 *      keeps them in the audit history.)
 *
 * ⚠ SCOPE. This is a READ. It writes nothing, and no gate, fuel rule or alert
 *   consults it. Riders the registry has never tracked are simply absent from the
 *   output, and their callers keep the rider-keyed answer they have always had.

     * ⭐⭐ ONE CARD PER DATE — the day read top to bottom, the way it happened
     *     (owner review, Aug-13).
     *
     * The old list printed a separate block per RIDER, so a handover date arrived as
     * two fragments and the manager assembled the story himself. A date is one thing
     * that happened to one machine: it opens on a meter, things occur, it closes on a
     * meter. That is the card.
     *
     * ⭐ LINE ORDER IS DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED. Meters and handovers carry a clock;
     *   claims usually do not — but they carry an ODOMETER, which places them
     *   physically between the open and the close. So a fill at 25,479 lands between
     *   a 25,420 start and a 25,595 close without anyone recording a time for it.
     *   Verified against the real August cards (see test_day_cards.php).
