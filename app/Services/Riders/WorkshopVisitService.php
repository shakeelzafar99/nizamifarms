/**
 * 🔧 WORKSHOP VISITS — "Asim, take AY-4771 in on Friday at 11" (owner ask, Sep-2026).
 *
 * Plan: VEHICLE-TICKETS-AND-WORKSHOP-PLAN-SEP2026.md §3.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ NOT A DAY TAG. `t_ops_day_tag` means "not needed — paid, not counted absent" and
 *    changes pay and absence treatment. OWNER RULING (2-Sep): a workshop day is a NORMAL
 *    PAID WORKING DAY; the person planning the shift adjusts that day so no lateness
 *    lands. So this is its own row that every surface READS, and nothing here ever
 *    writes a day tag.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE VISIT NAMES ONE PERSON, and that is what makes acceptance meaningful. The
 *    banner, the push and the Accept button all resolve `user_id` and nobody else, so a
 *    rider can never see — let alone accept — someone else's instruction. A manager may
 *    accept ON HIS BEHALF when the app is not working, and that is stored as such and
 *    rendered as "accepted by X for Y", never as the rider's own confirmation.
 *
 * ⭐ MISSED IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED. A visit whose date has passed while still
 *   scheduled/accepted is "missed" — computed at read time, exactly like the service
 *   alerts. Prod has no cron, so anything that depended on a nightly job to set a flag
 *   would simply never run (see [[prod-has-no-scheduler-cron]]).
 *
 * ⚠ Schema-guarded throughout: the PHP may be uploaded before
 *   `database/migrations/workshop_visits_sep2026.sql` runs.

     *    `resolveLocation()` → the assignment's location → `LocationService`. So a rider who

     *    late flag — with no change to attendance code at all. Owner intent, 2-Sep: "later
     *    workshop will be added as the shift location".
     *
     * ⚠⚠ THE SHIFT TIMES ARE NOT TOUCHED. The override reuses the template he was already on
     *    that day and changes ONLY `location_id`. A workshop day is a normal paid working day
     *    (owner ruling) — this must never become a way to shorten or move his hours.
     *
     * ⚠ `notified_at` is left NULL ON PURPOSE, so this does NOT raise the "your shift is
     *   changing — confirm" banner. He already confirms the VISIT; asking twice for one fact
     *   is how people start ignoring both.
     *
     * ⚠ It NEVER overwrites an override the planner made himself. If a bounded row already
     *   covers that day, his decision stands and this returns false — a scheduling convenience
     *   must not silently undo a human's deliberate change.
     *

     *   `clearShiftLocation()` on cancel / reschedule, so nothing outlives the visit.

         * ⚠⚠ THE SHIFT RULES APPLY HERE TOO (Sep-2026). This method writes a real one-day row
         *    into `t_ops_user_shift_assignment` WITHOUT going through the gated
         *    `ShiftController` engine, so it is a second door onto somebody's working day —
         *    and the shift-authority round would have left it unwatched.
         *
         *    Three things it let through before this check, all found by
         *    `probe_workshop_shift_seam.php`:
         *      • FAROOQ HOLDS A BIKE, so a visit can be booked for him — and as a planner he
         *        could approve it himself, writing his own one-day shift row. The one rule the
         *        owner cared about most ("nobody sets his own shift") went out of this door.
         *      • a planner could pin somebody ABOVE him on the ladder;
         *      • the Adjust picker could move a rider onto a shift OUTSIDE the allowed list
         *        Taimur set for him — refused by the planner screens, accepted here.
         *
         * ⭐ Only a DENY blocks. An "approval needed" verdict is fine: this pin IS a planner
         *   approving, and demanding a second approval to move a check-in place would make the
         *   ordinary workshop day unusable. For a plain rider — the overwhelming case — the
         *   gate answers ALLOW and nothing about today's behaviour changes.

     * ⚠⚠ THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Arrival is proved by a geofence, and a geofence needs a pin.
     *    A visit booked through the free-text "Workshop name (not on the list)" box has none,

     *    to the workshop" all day, with no ETA and no arrival — for every screen, forever.
     *    Banning free text was rejected: a manager genuinely may not know the place. So the
     *    rider's OWN arrival becomes the pin, and every later visit there is automatic.
     *
     * ⭐ Runs inside the heartbeat the phone ALREADY sends. Nothing new runs on the device and
     *   nothing polls; `maybeAskArrival` only ever writes the "ask him" flag.
