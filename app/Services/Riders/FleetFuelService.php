/**
 * Fleet & Fuel (Jul-2026) — what each rider's bike costs per month.
 *
 * Two different money models sit side by side and must NOT be averaged
 * together, which is the whole point of this screen:
 *
 *   • OWN bike  — paid a per-km rate for SHIFT kilometres only. The claim is
 *                 built from the attendance meter, so it audits itself.
 *   • COMPANY bike — the firm buys the actual fuel, so EVERY kilometre costs
 *                 money, including the ride home and personal use. Claims are
 *                 flat cash amounts with no km attached.
 *
 * So cost-per-km uses a different denominator per bike type (`basis_km`), and
 * the UI always says which. Averaging them would flatter the company bikes.
 *
 * Meter data contains real typos (dropped digits, test rows, one rider once
 * entered ANOTHER rider's odometer). Every reading passes plausibility bounds
 * before it can move a number — see isSaneDay()/isSaneGap().

     *
     * "Early" is worth surfacing because a service at 300 km on a 500 km schedule
     * is either money spent sooner than needed or a bike with a problem; either
     * way the approver should see it before paying. Repairs are never measured
     * this way — they are ad-hoc by definition and never reset the clock.
     *
     * Needs the odometer at the service (`meter_at_fill`), so it stays null for
     * everything filed before that field existed rather than being guessed.
     *
     * ⭐⭐ THREE THINGS CHANGED IN AUG-2026, all so this can never again contradict
     *    the frozen `service_due_km` printed on the SAME ROW. The live screen showed
     *    Waseem's 16-Aug oil change as "⏱ serviced 297 km early" AND "🔴 done 43 km
     *    overdue" at once; on Kanan's 17-Aug row the two were 1,351 km apart.
     *
     *    1. WHICH ROWS COUNT is the TYPE's call, not `service_type`'s. That column
     *       says only "regular", so Chain Set and Brake Shoe — both flagged
     *       `resets_service_clock = 0` — were being chained as if they were services.
     *       Waseem's anchor was a Chain Set at 25,007 when the real oil anchor was
     *       24,667. Same predicate the approval hook uses: `resetsClock()`.
     *    2. THE ANCHOR IS THE MACHINE'S, not the man's — `lastServicePointBefore`,
     *       the identical call that produced the frozen figure, including its
     *       "covers" rule (a tuning is never measured from a mere oil change).
     *    3. THE INTERVAL IS THE JOB'S OWN. Measuring a 10,000 km brake-shoe job
     *       against the 1,200 km oil schedule reported it "151 km overdue", which is
     *       noise dressed as a finding.
     *
     * ⭐ Where the row already carries `service_due_km`, that number IS the answer —
     *    it was frozen at approval against evidence that no longer exists, so
     *    recomputing it could only ever disagree with it. Note that early/late then
     *    come out EXACTLY equal to the frozen figure whatever interval is in force,
     *    since both sides divide out. Only the "▲ N km since last service" line
     *    depends on the interval, which is why the precedence below has to mirror
     *    `BikeServiceClock::stampServiceDueKm` — change one, change both.
