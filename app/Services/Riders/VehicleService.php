/**
 * The vehicle registry (Aug-2026) — bikes and the van as real, assignable rows.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * A meter reading belongs to a MACHINE, but every rule in the system keys off the
 * RIDER. The moment a rider borrows another bike, the morning continuity check,
 * the odometer window, the service clock and the running-cost figures all misfire
 * at once (Danish on Arslan's bike, Jul-29). This class is the missing entity.
 *
 * ⭐ PHASE A IS DELIBERATELY INERT. Nothing in here is consulted by any meter,
 *    fuel or alert rule yet — those still read the rider, exactly as before, until
 *    `VEHICLE_RULES` is flipped to 'Y' in Phase C. What this class does today is
 *    let the fleet be recorded and assigned, so the data can be checked BEFORE
 *    anything depends on it.
 *
 * ⭐ EVERY PUBLIC METHOD IS SAFE BEFORE THE SQL IS RUN. `available()` gates the
 *    whole class on the table existing, so an upload-before-SQL degrades to "no
 *    Vehicles view" rather than throwing. Same discipline as MaintenanceTypeService.
 *
 * THE ONE BEHAVIOUR-AFFECTING WRITE is the `company_bike` mirror in assign() —
 * see the comment there. It is intended, it is what makes the flag stay true, and
 * previewAssign() exists so the manager is told in words before he commits.

     *   • approved Maintenance claims attributed to THIS machine — through

     *

     *
     * ⭐⭐ …BUT PLAUSIBILITY IS RELATIVE TO THE MACHINE'S OWN CHAIN, ANCHORED IN TIME
     *    (Aug-2026, MachineAttribution's rule R-B, applied here at last). The bare
     *    floor is right for a 47,000 km bike and catastrophic for a NEW one: EDN-198
     *    has never read above 800, so its approved Rs 1,000 oil change at 659 km was
     *    thrown away by every consumer of this rule — the bike had no service clock,
     *    and the claim's `service_due_km` was never stamped.
     *
     * ⚠⚠ WHY THE DATE, NOT A PER-MACHINE FLAG (review, same day). A dropped digit
     *    means the machine had ALREADY read far above the number when it was written
     *    down — that is a fact about a moment, not about the machine. The first cut
     *    of this fix classified whole machines by their MAXIMUM reading, which put a
     *    cliff at the floor: the week EDN-198's odometer passed 1,000 km, its flag
     *    would flip and the 659 km service — a historical fact — would have been
     *    thrown away all over again, days before its oil change came due. Anchored to
     *    the reading's own date, the verdict on a record can never change afterwards:
     *    the 659 stays valid when the bike reads 15,000, and a three-figure typo
     *    typed on that same bike NEXT year is still refused, because by then the
     *    machine HAD read far above it.
     *
     *    A reading over the floor passes outright, as it always has — the relaxation
     *    only ever examines the sub-floor case, so every 5-figure reading on the
     *    fleet answers bit-for-bit as before. A machine with no raw readings at all
     *    keeps the strict rule: "unknown" must never buy laxity.
     *
     * @param string|null $onDate the reading's own date. Null = judge against the
     *        machine's whole history — the conservative answer, right for callers
     *        with no date, wrong for historical rows (their verdict would drift as

     * ⭐⭐ THE COVERS RULE (owner ruling, Aug-16).
     *
     * A clock-resetting service also refreshes every clock-resetting type with a
     * SMALLER-OR-EQUAL interval. An Oil + Tuning (2,500 km) necessarily includes the
     * oil change, so it refreshes Oil Change (1,200 km) too; an Oil Change does NOT
     * refresh Oil + Tuning, because no tuning happened.
     *
     * ⭐ WHY: without it the team has to record the same physical job twice to keep
     *    both countdowns honest — which is exactly what they were already doing by
     *    hand (three records for one Aug-6 service). The system now does it for them,
     *    and a job entered once stops producing a phantom "overdue" for the smaller
     *    service it plainly contained.
     *
     * ⚠ NON-RESETTING TYPES ARE NEVER TOUCHED, in either direction. Brake Shoe is
     *   real work on its own 10,000 km cycle; it neither covers nor is covered, so a
     *   big service can never make worn brake shoes look replaced. That is the same
     *   safety rule `resets_service_clock` was created for — see
     *   [[maintenance-types-and-meter-date-rule]].

     * ⭐⭐ THE ONE OVERALL SERVICE STATE — what every surface now renders.
     *
     * ⚠⚠ THIS REPLACES READING `t_ops_vehicle.last_service_meter` DIRECTLY, and that
     *    is the whole point. Those columns were seeded once when the registry was
     *    created (Aug-4) and NOTHING has ever updated them: both writers stamp the
     *    RIDER's profile. So the machine row silently froze, and the rider's phone —
     *    the only surface reading it — told Arslan his bike was 233 km overdue while
     *    the web panel and the alerts correctly said "142 km left". Three stores of
     *    one fact, and the stalest one was the one facing the rider.
     *
     *    The cure is to stop storing the answer. This derives it, at read time, from
     *    the machine's own evidence — the same evidence the per-type schedule and the
     *    service alerts already read — so the surfaces cannot drift apart again.
     *
     * ⭐⭐ THE HEADLINE **IS** THE MOST URGENT SCHEDULED JOB — not a separate clock.
     *
     *    This is what finally makes the surfaces agree. A first cut measured the
     *    overall state against the LAST job's interval, and AY-4771 immediately
     *    disagreed with itself: the banner read "ok, due in 874" (Oil + Tuning's
     *    2,500 km) while the panel underneath it — and the service alert — correctly
     *    read "Oil Change overdue by 426". Same bike, same second, two answers: the
     *    very complaint this work exists to end.
     *
     *    "Is this bike due for service?" means "is ANY scheduled job due?", so the
     *    headline now reports the worst row of the per-type panel and names it. The
     *    banner, the panel and the alert are then the same computation read at three
     *    levels of detail, and cannot drift apart by construction.
     *
     * LEGACY FALLBACK (no typed history — most machines until Aug-2026), best
     * (highest meter) wins:
     *   1. legacy UNTYPED approved claims flagged `oil_change`/`general`;
     *   2. the seeded `t_ops_vehicle` columns — demoted from truth to just another
     *      candidate, so a machine with no other history keeps the state it had;
     *   3. the keeper's profile stamp, but ONLY when he actually held THIS machine on
     *      that date (⚠ without that guard a rider's stamp from his previous bike
     *      would leak onto the new one — the exact bike-swap contamination that
     *      [[bike-swap-breaks-meter-rules]] is about).
     *

     *                                            must not create a second row)
     *   2. release the vehicle's current keeper on this date
     *   3. release the rider from whatever he was holding (one default per rider —
     *      the mirror column can only carry one id)
     *   4. open the new assignment row
     *   5. point the rider's profile at it (`default_vehicle_id`)
     *
     * ⭐ WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES **NOT** TOUCH: `t_ops_rider_profile.company_bike`.
     *
     *    That flag is read by a dozen LIVE call sites — FuelClaimRules::ridesCompanyBike,
     *    HomeJourneyService::riderHomePin (which arms the whole overnight meter flow),
     *    WorkJourneyService::workIssues, FleetFuelService, the attendance surfaces.
     *    Writing it from an assignment would mean pressing "Assign" silently changes
     *    whose fuel the company buys, who is asked for a meter, and whose overnight
     *    checks arm — while `VEHICLE_RULES` is still OFF and this phase is supposed to
     *    record the fleet, not govern it.
     *
     *    It is also unfixable in the release direction: when a rider hands a bike back
     *    he holds nothing, and BOTH answers are wrong. Leaving it at 1 keeps the per-km
     *    petrol block lifted for someone with no company bike (a money risk, since
     *    isPerKmRider() short-circuits on this flag); forcing it to 0 disarms the
     *    overnight flow for a rider who may simply have had his bike in the workshop
     *    for a day. There is no safe automatic answer, which is the tell that the
     *    write does not belong here.
     *
     *    Phase C settles it properly: the rules read the VEHICLE through
     *    VehicleResolver, `company_bike` stops being consulted, and no mirror is
     *    needed. Until then the flag stays exactly as the owner set it, and
     *    previewAssign() says plainly that fuel treatment changes only once vehicle
     *    rules are switched on.

     *
     * ⚠ WHY IT MATTERS EVEN THOUGH THE REGISTRY ALREADY OUTRANKS THE CHECKBOX.
     *   Fuel treatment, the meter demands and the ⛽ attendance tick all ask the
     *   registry per date, so they were already correct. But TWO places still read
     *   the raw column, and they silently skipped a newly-assigned rider:
     *     • `WorkJourneyService::workIssueDays` — selects `company_bike = 1` AND a
     *       home pin, so "no home start", the ride-in ETA and overnight meter
     *       continuity were simply not evaluated for him;
     *     • the DayChecks population widener, which then falls back to guessing from
     *       his ROLE NAME containing "rider".
     *   Measured on the replica: a rider handed a company bike was skipped by both
     *   until a human remembered the tick. Syncing the column closes that hole
     *   without touching the rules that were already right.
     *
     * ⚠⚠ NEVER TOUCHES `meter_required`. That is a deliberate per-person exemption a
     *    manager sets ("this one does not do meters"); the registry already answers
     *    the meter gate, and overwriting it here would erase an intentional decision.
     *
     * ⚠⚠ GATED ON `VEHICLE_RULES`. While the switch is off, an assignment is
     *    "recorded, not yet enforced" — the assign preview says exactly that to the
     *    manager — and the checkbox is the ONLY authority. Writing it then would
     *    enforce the assignment through the back door and make that promise a lie.
     *
     * ⭐ LAST WRITER WINS (owner ruling): a manual edit stands until the rider's
     *    machine actually changes again. No "manually overridden" marker — a flag
     *    that freezes the column would quietly stop tracking reality, which is the
     *    problem this method exists to fix.
     *
     * Non-fatal and idempotent: it writes only on a real change, and a rider with no
     * profile row is a silent no-op (assign() already warns about that case).

     *
     * ⚠ WHY. The rider-keyed window breaks the moment a bike changes hands:
     *   Danish's own history peaks ~33,700, so his first fill on DCR-799
     *   (~24,800) reads "lower than this bike's 33,700" and is refused — the

     *   the mistake it exists to catch (typing the OLD bike's meter) would
     *   PASS. Built from the machine's own series, both come out right.
     *
     * Sources, same trust order as `claimsForVehicle`:
     *   • attendance meters of whoever HELD the bike, inside their window;
     *   • claims STAMPED with this vehicle;
     *   • unstamped claims by a keeper inside his window (pre-Aug history).
     *
     * A machine with no readings yet returns [null, null] — no constraint, which
     * is correct for a fresh bike. Errors return null so the caller can fall
     * back to the rider-keyed window rather than losing the check entirely.

     *   • a LIFETIME average is impossible — the bikes' first kilometres predate

     *   • the old figure was keyed to the RIDER's month, so Danish — given

     *   • REPAIRS  — a named type whose bucket is `repair`; legacy `repair` / `general`.

     *                from it (owner: "I need this to calculate the machine average").
     *   • UNCLASSIFIED — a maintenance claim that names neither. 109 of the 140 legacy rows are
     *                these. ⚠ Shown as its own figure, NEVER silently folded into a bucket:
     *                a total that quietly absorbs what it could not identify is a lie.

     *    reads ~73,800. He photographed his own bike's meter at 11:58 and the Van reached him at
     *    12:09 — both entirely correct actions. But `t_ops_attendance` holds ONE meter pair per
     *    rider-day and the registry ONE open assignment per rider, so his own bike's reading was
     *    filed against the Van. A magnitude test against the machine's OWN spine is what tells
     *    the two apart, and it is the same philosophy MachineAttribution states as rule R-B:
     *    plausibility is relative to the machine's own chain, never an absolute floor.
     *
     * ⭐ FAILS OPEN, deliberately. No spine — a machine with no evidence of its own, a brand-new
     *   bike — means every reading is accepted, exactly as before this rule existed. Rejecting on
     *   silence would blank out young machines, which is the precise mistake the absolute
     *   MIN_METER floor made on EDN-198.

     * ⭐⭐ R10 — HOW FAR FROM ITS OWN CHAIN IS STILL "THE SAME MACHINE"? (Aug-22 2026)
     *
     * ⚠⚠ A FLAT ±MAX_GAP_KM IS WRONG WHEN THE SPINE IS THIN. Rule P's first day on prod refused a
     *    perfectly good 47,275 against a lone 49,521 (AY-4771): with a single known point, ±2,000 km
     *    is a 4,000 km keyhole, and any reading older than a couple of months falls outside it. The
     *    question Rule P asks is "could this be a DIFFERENT machine's odometer?", and that is a
     *    question of PROPORTION — 47,275 vs 49,521 is obviously the same bike; 6,639 vs 73,900
     *    obviously is not.
     *
     * ⭐ So the tolerance scales with the odometer: 20% of the machine's own highest reading, never
     *   less than MAX_GAP_KM. A new bike reading 400 km keeps the flat 2,000 floor (percentages are
     *   useless there); a 74,000 km van gets ~14,800, which still rejects a 6,639 by a mile.
     *
     * ⚠ Deliberately generous. Every failure mode of being too LOOSE is caught downstream (the
     *   floor is a MAX, the ceil keeps MIN_METER, the typo guard still runs); being too TIGHT
     *   silently deletes real history, which is what this incident was.

     * ⚠⚠ THE PROD BUG THIS EXISTS FOR (EDN-198, Aug-16-2026). The odometer
     *    reconstruction and the claim-validation window both walk a keeper's
     *    assignment window and take EVERY reading he made inside those dates. That
     *    is wrong whenever two windows overlap the same day — and a same-day
     *    assignment reversed within the day leaves exactly that.
     *
     *    EDN-198 was mis-assigned to Asim on 2026-08-09 and handed straight back:
     *        Farooq 08-08 → 08-09  ·  Asim 08-09 → 08-09  ·  Farooq 08-09 → OPEN
     *    Asim also holds his OWN bike (an OPEN row). The window loop pulled his
     *    own bike's 12,390 km into a brand-new EDN-198 whose real odometer is ~659,
     *    which then became the floor every claim on it was judged against —
     *    Farooq's honest 659 km oil-change was refused as "lower than this bike's
     *    12,390 km".
     *
     * ⭐ THE RESOLVER ALREADY KNEW BETTER. `vehicleForDay` ranks an OPEN assignment
     *    above a closed one, so it correctly puts Asim's 08-09 readings on his own
     *    bike. The reconstruction simply never asked it. This bridges the two.
