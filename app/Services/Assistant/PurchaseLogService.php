/**
 * WhatsApp purchase-log screenshots → weighted vendor purchases.
 *
 * Taimur's butcher posts each weighing into the vendor's WhatsApp group as it
 * happens ("Mutton 12.5" at 9:15, "Mutton 5.1" at 2:59, "Chakki . 650"…). He
 * screenshots the chat and types the day up by hand. This turns the screenshot
 * into the same entry he would have made.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE SHAPE WAS NOT DESIGNED — IT WAS READ OFF HIS OWN LEDGER. The sample
 * screenshots are already in the books, so the conventions are settled facts:
 *   • ONE weighted purchase per vendor per DAY (ledger 19307 = six weights of
 *     one day on one entry), and
 *   • ONE LINE PER MESSAGE, never summed — so every line stays checkable
 *     against the chat, with the screenshot attached as the receipt.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ VENDOR PRODUCTS ARE NOT THE SALES CATALOG. Purchases live entirely in
 * `t_fin_vendor_products` / `t_fin_vendor_purchase_items` (per-vendor names,
 * units and rates, managed on the vendor screen). The customer-facing catalog
 * (`t_pdm_*`) is never read or written here — verified across every writer of
 * `vendor_product_id`. Nothing in this class may reference it.
 *
 * Everything here is READ-ONLY: it proposes a card. Money moves only when
 * Taimur taps Confirm, through the existing weighted-purchase endpoint.

     *     "3." inside the quantity "13.5" — a weight could pick a product.

     *     alphabetical order, so "veal undercut" resolved to "Veal boneless"
     *     (Rs 1,650 instead of Rs 2,500) — and every other "veal …" phrase with
     *     it. Verified against Jilani, Imran, Ghousia and Meat Inn.
     *
     * Now scored on WORD OVERLAP, which is what a human reads:
     *   1. most query words matched wins  ("veal undercut" → 4. Veal Undercut)
     *   2. then the vendor's DEFAULT product ("Mutton" → 1. Mutton Whole, not
     *      Mutton Paaye — the bare word means his usual cut)
     *   3. then the tightest name (fewest words the phrase didn't ask for)
