/**
 * STORAGE (SUPPLIES STOCK) — the one engine.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE RULE THE WHOLE FEATURE RESTS ON
 * The paying account moves EXACTLY ONCE, when the stock is bought:
 *
 *      book in   paying account  ->  SUPPLIES_STOCK   type 'supply_purchase'
 *      take out  SUPPLIES_STOCK  ->  EXP_<category>   type 'expense' (via a request)
 *
 * A take-out therefore NEVER names the paying account as its payment source — doing
 * so would make BalancePostingService take the cash a second time. The paying account
 * is carried in the take-out's DESCRIPTION instead, so every screen that prints a
 * description still shows where the money originally came from, and no screen has to
 * change. The same reason `receiving_account_id` stays NULL on a take-out: the
 * per-bank outflow was already counted at purchase.
 *
 * ⭐ COST ALLOCATION — the remainder rule
 * Packets 1..N-1 are rounded to the paisa and the LAST one takes whatever is left, so
 * SUM(packet.cost) == batch.total_cost to the paisa. For pieces, the take-out that
 * empties a batch takes `cost_remaining` rather than n x unit_cost. Never n x rounded:
 * that is how a batch ends up a few rupees short of the money that actually left.
 *
 * ⭐ FIFO
 * Oldest batch first, always — so a cheaper old batch is consumed before a dearer new
 * one, and the rupee figure on a packet is the price actually paid for it.

     * Was `consumePieces` (cups, counted). Round 3 routes WEIGHT through it too, which is
     * what makes the real flow work: a bale is weighed once on a tray and booked as one
     * label, then the small packets inside it are scanned out one at a time. Before this,
     * one scanned label was one indivisible packet, so scanning a 1.5 kg inner packet could
     * only take the whole 26.97 kg bale — which is exactly what happened on Sep-17-2026.
     *
     * May cross a purchase boundary (owner ruling: allowed, and silently) — 1.5 kg when the
     * oldest bale has 0.27 kg left produces two legs at two rates, still ONE request.
     *
     * ⚠ THE RESIDUE SWEEP IS NOT AN EDGE CASE HERE. The owner keeps buying before the pool
     * runs out, so purchases always overlap. A tray weighs 26.97 kg but the packets inside
     * it sum to 26.9 or 27.05 — real drift, every bale. Without the sweep the older purchase
     * would sit at the head of the FIFO queue forever holding 70 g that no packet ever
     * matches, and EVERY take-out after it would split into two legs for no reason. So a
     * purchase left with a sliver is emptied into the take-out that got it there.

     * ⭐ Correct the price of a batch that was entered wrong — even after some of it has
     * been used. (Voiding only works while a batch is untouched, and a typo is usually
     * spotted after a packet or two has gone out.)
     *
     * WHAT MOVES, and why:
     *  1. The PURCHASE row is amended in place at its ORIGINAL date. The cash really did
     *     leave that day — only the amount was wrong — so the bank/cash account is
     *     corrected by the difference on the day it actually happened.
     *  2. Every packet is RE-COSTED at the new total, by weight, last-takes-remainder.
     *  3. A packet already taken out and APPROVED had an expense posted at the old share.
     *     That row is reversed, amended and re-applied on its ORIGINAL expense date — the
     *     packet was genuinely used that day, only the rupee figure was wrong. Correcting
     *     it in place is what keeps each month's packaging cost true; posting the whole
     *     difference into today's month instead would misstate BOTH months.
     *  4. A take-out still PENDING has no ledger yet — only its request amount changes.
     *
     * ⚠ This DOES move a figure in a month that may already have been read. It is the
     *   honest answer (the month's real packaging cost was always the corrected one), but
     *   the caller must tell the user which months are affected before they confirm —
     *   see previewPriceCorrection().
