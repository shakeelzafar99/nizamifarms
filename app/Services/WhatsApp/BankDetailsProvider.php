/**
 * THE single source of truth for our receiving bank accounts in customer-facing
 * WhatsApp text (Aug-2026).
 *
 * Before this class the same accounts were hardcoded in THREE places that had
 * already drifted apart:
 *   - database/migrations/seed_wa_templates_register_jun2026.sql  (Alfalah + Meezan + Askari)
 *   - app/Http/Controllers/API/WhatsAppController::buildTemplateDisplayText  (HBL + Meezan)
 *   - resources/views/fin/employee/outstanding-invoices.blade.php fuBankDetailsMessage (HBL + Meezan)
 * Owner ruling (Aug-31-2026): the `invoice_paychange` set is the correct one —
 * Bank Alfalah / Meezan / Askari, NO HBL.
 *
 * The text is overridable at runtime via the t_fin_config key below, so the
 * accounts can be corrected WITHOUT a code deploy (this app deploys by hand).
 * The constant is only the fallback when that key is absent or blank.
 *
 * NOTE ON META TEMPLATES: a template's approved body lives on Meta, not here.
 * This class is for text WE compose — the free-form reply sent when a customer
 * taps "Get bank details", and the wa.me manual fallback. Changing it does NOT
 * change an approved template.
